<p><b></b>Hello World.</b> Well, it has been a while seen I have updated this page so I gues I'm going to put a little summary of what I plan to do with this place.
I am going to make it look more decent, as well as adding multiple new items to my page.</p>
<ol>
  <li><Actually Order</li>
  <ul>I will have a heading, align and all that jazz. I think it will be nice. I'll also find a suitable background color.</ul>
  <li> Multiple pages</a></li>
  <ul>I plan to have a updates pages, a schedule page, and a hobbiest page. Need that.</ul>
</ol>

<aside><p>Fighting games are my personal pleasure. I really enjoy Street Fighter, Injustice, but I love <u>Tekken</u>.
I plan to get a PS4 soon but as always a computer comes first. PC master race status, check that out. As the new Street Fighter 5 looks
good as well. It's a good time for fighting gamers.
